so execute action has two ways

    def execute_action(self, player, action):

        :return: N/A
        """
        player_code = self.player_code_mapping[player]
        # self.num_calls += 1
        if self.track_metrics:
            # Track agent action
            self.tracker.update(target="game", metric_name="agent_action", player=player, agent_action=action,
                                phase=self.phases[self.phase_num])

        if self.phases[self.phase_num] == self.pinning_phase_name:
            self.pin_planning(player_code, action)
        elif self.phases[self.phase_num] == self.planning_phase_name:
            self.action_planning(player_code, action)
        # If all characters have exhausted their action points, move phase along
        # If this is turned off, all players must submit first before progressing
        # if all([obj.action_points <= 0 for obj in self.board.objects.values() if isinstance(obj, Player)]):

        #    self.update_phase()
        # Render grid
        # if self.render_game:
        #    self.render()


one is if all action points for players are off then move to next stage
other 

other option is if all players have placed the pin finalized
            for p in self.player_code_mapping.values():
                # Reset values
                self.board.objects[p].pin_x = None
                self.board.objects[p].pin_y = None
                self.board.objects[p].pin_finalized = False

other option is if all placers have placed there action palns
elif curr_phase == self.planning_phase_name \
                and all([self.board.objects[p].action_plan_finalized
                         for p in self.player_code_mapping.values()
                         if not self.board.objects[p].dead]):

not clear to me how to drop the pin

placing a pin costs an action point

undo
	odes nothing in pin planing phase
	# Can only undo during action planning if there is an action in the action plan and user has not submitted
	so can likely ignore undo action

moving costs an action point I think

submit finalizes the pin
	adds to the scene objects {'name': 'PA', 'type': 'pin', 'x': 1, 'y': 1, 'placedBy': 'Giant'}

submit finalizes the action plan as well

pin action is first select pin type (when you do it resets to your location)
	then select the directions to where you want to put it
	then finalize it
	need a ping selected and submitted to show up in the map
	only after all 3 submits are done does state move (I think, test next)
	I don't think the state updates this at all
